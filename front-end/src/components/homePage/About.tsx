            Entering post-secondary I knew I enjoyed a challenge and my interests/skills lead me into the engineering program, but I did not expect the mandatory "Introduction to Programming" course to make an impact on my life so quickly. Since then Iâ€™ve enjoyed finding new things to learn whenever I can as I continue to explore the tech industry. As a recent graduate I am excited to start my career and practice my hobbies in a professional setting. Aside from programming, in my free time I enjoy getting active and keeping up with sports, although it seems I should stick to watching from the couch. Please reach out if you would like to chat!
